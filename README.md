# üéÑ Christmas Wishlist üéÅ

This project is a Christmas Wishlist application built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. It was created for my family to make a list of things I can buy them since they always say they don't know what they want or they don't want anything. Now, they can easily add their wishes, and I can make sure to get them the perfect gifts!
